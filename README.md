# passport-photo-resizer
This Python script resizes and crops casual photos into a standard passport size (600x600 pixels).
Project Description:
Passport Photo Resizer is a Python-based tool designed to resize and crop casual photos into standardized passport-sized photos. The script automatically detects the face in the image, resizes the image to fit the dimensions of a passport photo (600x600 pixels), and ensures that the face and shoulders are centered, with ears partially visible. The tool also sharpens the final image to ensure high clarity after resizing.

This project can be useful for people who need a passport photo but do not have immediate access to professional photo services. It provides an easy way to generate passport-sized photos directly from casual images taken on your phone or camera.
